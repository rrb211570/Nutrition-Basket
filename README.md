# Nutrition-Basket
App to help user calculate nutritional content of their groceries. (In Progress)

I've been cooking every meal I eat everyday, since shelter-in-place started, and I'm just finally starting to get down the lifecycle of my groceries. I'm trying to order at a rhythm of 7 days, ideally on Saturday/Sunday, but I guess sometimes I eat more or less, and my diet's not as streamlined as I'd like.

Anyway, I know that eventually I'm gonna want to start counting calories, and macros and stuff, so I wanted an easier way to calculate my daily nutrition based on my groceries. (I've tried manually writing down the stats for bananas as the first item on my list, but I got tired and gave up.)

As for this hacking month, I've been busy w/ school, and really the biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to behaviorally approach a side project.

I think the way to approach a side project, is to first consistently maintain awareness, and then build momentum. But I guess w/ Zoom University priorities, whenever I get stressed or anxious about school deadlines, my awareness of the side project dwindles until: I'm thinking about it, but not thinking about it enough, yenno?

This is an example of several behavioral roadblocks I'm trying to navigate right now, but it's been a very revealing experience for me.

Status: Up till now, I refreshed on C++, and I'm able to make stuff in Visual Studio (for the first time!). All I have right now is a command-line app. But I'm proud I got the project started, and got through a lot of the initial friction. I have a good idea where the project's gonna go next, and I'm excited to keep working on it.
